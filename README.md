# React Counter Project 🎉

This is a simple React-based counter application built with function-based components. The app demonstrates the use of React state, component reuse, and props to pass data between components.

## Features ✨
- **Function-based components**: Built with React's functional component structure.
- **State management**: The counter uses the `useState` hook to manage state.
- **Component reuse**: Components are reused with different props passed to achieve various functionality.
